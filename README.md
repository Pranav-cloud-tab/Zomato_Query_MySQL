# 🍽️ Zomato MySQL Project

## 📄 Description

This project demonstrates practical SQL skills through comprehensive analysis of a Zomato restaurant dataset. The objective is to explore and analyze key aspects of the restaurant industry using MySQL, applying advanced querying techniques to answer 21 business-driven questions.

The project begins with designing a normalized relational database schema suitable for storing restaurant data, including details such as location, cuisines offered, cost, online delivery and table booking options, customer ratings, and votes. The database schema ensures data integrity and supports complex querying through efficient relationships.

Once the database was created and populated with data, various SQL queries were written to extract meaningful insights. These queries cover a wide range of analytical objectives, including:

- Identifying popular cuisines and top-rated restaurants
- Analyzing customer preferences based on cost, delivery options, and ratings
- Exploring geographical distribution of restaurants
- Understanding correlations between cost and ratings
- Investigating restaurants offering multiple services (online delivery and table booking)

The project also includes a clear and well-structured **ER diagram** representing the database design, along with organized folders containing screenshots of each query and its result for transparency and validation.
